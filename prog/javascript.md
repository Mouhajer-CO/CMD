# JavaScript

- JavaScript (or "JS") is primarily used in the browser, enabling developers to manipulate webpage content through the DOM, draw graphics with canvas, interact with the device running the browser through various APIs, and more.
- JavaScript is one of the world's most commonly-used languages.
- Is a lightweight interpreted programming language, is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.
- JavaScript is a loosely typed or a dynamic language (type of variables is determined at runtime and infered by its value). JS uses `<script>` elements to apply external/internal code. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned.
- JavaScript is a single-threaded (processing of one command at a time) language so it can only execute a single task at a time. The rest of the tasks are queued in the Execution Context.

- JavaScript is a programming language used most often for dynamic client-side scripts on webpages, but it is also often used on the server-side, using a runtime such as **Node.js**.
- Node.js - built using Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine - allows developers to use JavaScript as a scripting language to automate things on a computer and build fully functional HTTP and WebSockets servers.
- Node.js is the most popular JavaScript runtime environment outside the browser.
